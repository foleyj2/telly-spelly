# Telly Spelly for KDE Plasma

A sleek KDE Plasma application that records audio and transcribes it in real-time using OpenAI's Whisper. Created by Guilherme da Silveira.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Easy Recording**: Start/stop recording with a single click in the system tray
- 🔊 **Live Volume Meter**: Visual feedback while recording
- ⚡ **Global Shortcuts**: Configurable keyboard shortcuts for quick recording
- 🎯 **Microphone Selection**: Choose your preferred input device
- 📋 **Instant Clipboard**: Transcribed text is automatically copied to your clipboard
- 🎨 **Native KDE Integration**: Follows your system theme and integrates seamlessly with Plasma

## Installation

1. Ensure all [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) are installed first.

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbasilveira/telly-spelly.git
cd telly-spelly
```

3. Run the installer:
```bash
python3 install.py
```

The installer will:
- Create a virtual environment with `--system-site-packages` (to access system whisper/torch)
- Install additional Python dependencies (PyQt6, numpy, scipy, etc.)
- Set up the application in your user directory
- Create desktop entries and icons
- Configure the launcher

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.11+ 
- KDE Plasma desktop environment
- PortAudio (for audio recording)
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, for faster transcription)

### 1. System Packages

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev python3-pip
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-pyaudio portaudio-devel python3-pip
```

### 2. OpenAI Whisper (System-wide)

This application requires OpenAI Whisper and PyTorch to be installed **system-wide** (not in a virtual environment). The app's venv uses `--system-site-packages` to access these.

```bash
# Install whisper and torch system-wide
sudo pip install openai-whisper torch --break-system-packages
```

> **Note:** The `--break-system-packages` flag is required on modern Debian/Ubuntu systems due to PEP 668. This is safe for these specific packages.

### 3. GPU Acceleration (Optional but Recommended)

For significantly faster transcription, install NVIDIA drivers:

**Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-580-open
sudo reboot
```

Verify GPU is available:
```bash
nvidia-smi
python3 -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Without GPU, whisper will use CPU (slower but functional).

## Usage

1. Launch "Telly Spelly" from your application menu or run:
```bash
telly-spelly
```

2. Click the tray icon or use configured shortcuts to start/stop recording
3. When recording stops, the audio will be automatically transcribed
4. The transcribed text is copied to your clipboard

## Configuration

- Right-click the tray icon and select "Settings"
- Configure:
  - Input device selection
  - Global keyboard shortcuts
  - Whisper model selection
  - Interface preferences

## Uninstallation

To remove the application:
```bash
python3 uninstall.py
```

## Technical Details

- Built with PyQt6 for the GUI
- Uses OpenAI's Whisper for transcription
- Integrates with KDE Plasma using system tray and global shortcuts
- Records audio using PyAudio
- Processes audio with scipy for optimal quality
